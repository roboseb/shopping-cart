#Seb's Shopping Cart

---Devlog---

June 27th, 2022

    New day, new project. Took a second of brainstorming and thirty seconds of urinating to come up with a good idea for an interesting shopping cart, and I think I've got one. Remember when there was a panic surrounding furniture on Waifair having people names, and folk assuming that meant Waifair was selling people literally in the furniture? Well I think it would be fun to recreate the store page for an item on Waifair, but the rest of the UI is my style. The project will use a couple APIs to generate items for sale that have names that are comically human, and also give them excessive details that furniture would not normally have listed, such as:
        -birth date (this is funny because technically furniture would
        have a birthdate, it would just be listed as manufacturing date or something)

        -Nationality (same idea)

        -Height

        -Weight

        -Skin colour?

        -Bloodtype

        -Astrological sign

    As an outline, the store will initially generate a few sets of items so that it at least fulfills the project requirements. However, with the use of APIs, it should also be able to generate new items with photos and details.
