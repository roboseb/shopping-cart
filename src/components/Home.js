                Recently, there were allegations made against waifair.com
                alleging the facilition of human trafficking through
                the sale high-end storage pieces. These allegations were
                sadly unfounded, and our team found this to be a market with
                incredibly high demand that wasn't able to be fulfilled. So,
                as a small group of high-school dropout NFT investors, we knew
                that amongst our ranks were all the skills necessary to succeed
                in this emergent market.

                Along the path of our journey, we made some small improvments
                the formula. Waifair's listings only had minor clues to help
                their customer base find the right item for their needs.
                Regular furniture could often be confused for furniture girls,
                and the opposite was also true. This led to increased shipping
                costs for Waifair, and an increasingly negative experience for
                the consumer overall. To fix this, we sought to be as authentic
                as possible, and this led to a very simple naming convention.
                Furniture girls are able to keep their original names. Our data
                has proven that this is an incredible boon not only to customer
                satisfaction, but to the furniture girls themselves.

                <h3>FAQs</h3>
                <div>
                    Q: What range of manufacture dates do furniture girls come in? A:
                    For our protection and yours, we have found it much more practical
                    to omit manufacture dates on all our products. Q: I noticed that
                    your site does not ship to France, but it seems otherwise offers
                    international shipping, when are you going to fix this? A: We cannot
                    fix this concern, for it is not broken. Laythere.ca promises for the
                    good of the people of Earth not to engage in trade with France or any
                    of its territories. Q: I placed an order on a dark walnut ethnicity
                    dresser for my master bedroom three months ago, and haven't seen it
                    marked for shipment on your website. Please give me an ETA on the product
                    as me and the boys are real excited for this piece. A: The use of the
                    term, "master" has a long and dark history of use against marginalized
                    people the world over, and its continued use is equally harming today.
                    Please refrain from using this and similar terms on our site.
